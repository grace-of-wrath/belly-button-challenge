# belly-button-challenge
I have demonstrated an ability to use Plotly.js to create interactive charts. I populated a dropdown menu with id numbers from a JSON file containing data on belly button biodiversity. When an id is selected from the dropdown, the selection is passed to the app.js file, which queries the JSON file for data that matches the selection and then updates the charts to display the data.
